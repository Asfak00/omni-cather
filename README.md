# GHL Event Manager

A custom event / contract management app built on top of **GoHighLevel** for
restaurants and venues. Contacts arrive from your GHL reservation form, get
converted into fully-priced event contracts (menus, taxes, gratuity, deposits),
and produce a document set (BEO, Contract, Invoice, Kitchen Sheet, Menu,
Proposal) that shares out through GHL.

## The flow

```
GHL reservation form
      │  (lead lands in GHL contacts — contacts stay in GHL)
      ▼
GHL contact ──"Make Contract" link──▶  /make-contract?contactId={{contact.id}}
                                        │  (draft auto-created)
                                        ▼
                                     Contract editor
                                        │  event details · areas · status
                                        │  Food / Beverage / Other line items
                                        │  Add from Menu · Add Freehand
                                        │  billing widget (tax, gratuity,
                                        │  admin fee, deposit, F&B minimum)
                                        ▼
                                   Save & View Docs
                                        │
                                        ▼
                              Documents page (BEO, Contract,
                              Invoice, Kitchen Sheet, Menu, Proposal)
                                        │  Share / Email / Link
                                        ▼
                              GHL share & email pages
```

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) · **TypeScript** · **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- Server-side GHL v2 API client (`src/lib/ghl/`)
- JSON file persistence (`data/`) behind a one-file storage interface
  (`src/lib/store/file-store.ts`) — swap for GHL custom objects or a DB
  without touching UI code

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add your GHL credentials
npm run dev
```

Without credentials the app runs in **demo mode** with mock contacts, so the
whole flow is testable immediately.

### GHL credentials

1. In your GHL sub-account: **Settings → Private Integrations → New**
2. Grant `contacts.readonly`, `contacts.write`, `invoices.readonly`, `invoices.write`
3. Put the `pit-...` token in `GHL_API_KEY` and your location id in `GHL_LOCATION_ID`

## App areas

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/make-contract?contactId=...` | Entry point opened from GHL — auto-creates a draft event + contract for that contact (without a contactId it shows GHL setup instructions) |
| `/events` | Events list grouped Today / Next 7 Days / Beyond, with search + Upcoming/All filter |
| `/events/[id]` | Event view with tabs: Details, Docs, Discussion, Payments, Tasks, Notes, Log |
| `/events/[id]/edit` | Event editor (dates via shadcn calendar, guests, managers, lead sources, financial summary, custom fields) |
| `/contracts/[id]` | Contract & Event Order editor (contact info, line items from menus, kitchen notes, setup, billing widget with custom rows & tax compounding, terms) |
| `/settings/restaurant` | Menus, taxes & fees, venue areas, owners, event styles/types, default terms |
| `/settings/theme` | Theme colors, fonts, heading/paragraph sizes, radius — live preview + auto-save |

## Deploying

### Netlify

The repo ships with a [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) — connect the repo and
deploy; the official Next.js runtime plugin handles the App Router and API
routes automatically. **Important:** if the site was created before this
file existed, clear any custom *Publish directory* in Site settings → Build
& deploy (it must be left to the plugin) and trigger "Clear cache and
deploy site".

Set your environment variables in Site settings → Environment:

```
GHL_API_KEY=pit-...
GHL_LOCATION_ID=...
```

**Storage on serverless hosts:** Netlify/Vercel functions have a read-only
project filesystem, so the JSON store automatically falls back to `/tmp` +
an in-memory mirror (see `src/lib/store/file-store.ts`). That keeps the
whole app working, but `/tmp` is per-instance and ephemeral — edits can
reset between cold starts. For durable production data either:

- set `DATA_DIR` to a mounted persistent disk (self-hosted / Render /
  Railway volumes), or
- deploy with `npm run build && npm run start` on any Node host, or
- keep Netlify for the UI and rely on GHL as the source of truth
  (settings already mirror to a GHL Custom Value; contacts, messages and
  notes sync live).
